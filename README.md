# Rock Paper Scissors Game

A simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows the player to choose rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly selects its choice. The winner is determined based on the classic rules of the game.

## Features

- **User Input**: Players can choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors by clicking the corresponding button.
- **Computer Input**: The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
- **Result Display**: The game shows the result (win, loss, or tie) after each round.
- **Responsive Design**: The game works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How the Game Works

1. When the game starts, three buttons are displayed: **Rock**, **Paper**, and **Scissors**.
2. The player clicks one of the buttons to make their selection.
3. The computer then randomly selects one of the three options.
4. The game compares the player's choice with the computer's choice and determines the winner.
5. The result (win, loss, or tie) is displayed on the screen, showing both the player's and the computer's choices.
